                    <h3>A True Non Profit Health Plan for Utah, in Utah</h3>
                    <p>Unlike typical insurance companies we don’t answer to share holders or a traditionally distant board of directors. Arches will answer to you, our members, who will elect the Board and make up two-thirds of the Board of Directors. By law, any “proﬁt” must go towards our members’ beneﬁt. By working together as a community of CO-OP members to manage our resources wisely, we will ﬁnd savings to improve services or lower premium costs for our members. Arches is not owned by a clinic or hospital chain. If we can help our members live healthier, they won’t need to seek as many services which cost money. Arches will then be able to send the savings back to our members and the providers who helped them stay healthy. Now that’s a win-win we can all live with! Based in Utah, the Arches team has deep Utah roots and connections with communities most likely to beneﬁt from health care reform.</p>

                  <h2>Member Governed</h2>
                  <p>Arches is organized much like a credit union. Over the next couple of years the members will truly govern Arches Health Plan. Today Arches is run by a transitional Board of Directors ArchesHealth.org/Board. By 2015 we will begin electing members to our Board. A majority will come from the ranks of our members. The remaining spots are reserved for individuals with expertise in health care and insurance such as actuaries or providers. To help prepare members for the Board, Arches will be oﬀering opportunities to participate in Arches Board advisory groups and regional councils starting in 2014. For more information, please send an email to Advocate@ArchesHealth.org.</p>

                  <h2>Bending the Cost Curve, Improving Care</h2>
                  <p>The founders of Arches Health Plan believe that the current health care system is unsustainable. As we bring members into the leadership of the Arches Board, we will slowly become “the way healthcare gets better.” This means a new commitment by Arches and incentives to help your physician spend more time with you for your beneﬁt. For some members, especially those living in remote areas of Utah, it may make sense to have a phone consult or internet follow up consult. For the ﬁrst time, your provider will be paid for doing this without all the hassles of the traditional insurance company.</p>
